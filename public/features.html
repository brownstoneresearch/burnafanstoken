    <h1>Key Features of the $BURNA Ecosystem</h1>
    <p>The $BURNA platform is designed to revolutionize how fans and creators interact, transact, and grow value within the Afrobeat-powered Web3 ecosystem. Below are the core features that make $BURNA more than a token — it's a decentralized cultural movement.</p>

    <div class="feature">
      <h2>1. Decentralized Governance (DAO)</h2>
      <p>
        The $BURNA DAO allows every token holder to become a decision-maker. Through a secure, blockchain-powered voting system, users can submit proposals, vote on ecosystem upgrades, allocate treasury funds, and shape the future of the platform. This governance ensures community ownership, transparency, and alignment between creators and fans.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="feature">
      <h2>2. Web3 Music NFTs</h2>
      <p>
        Creators can tokenize their music and moments as NFTs, giving fans verifiable ownership of audio, artwork, and exclusive concert access. These NFTs are more than collectibles — they unlock token-gated experiences, backstage privileges, unreleased content, and long-term investment value through resale or staking integrations.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="feature">
      <h2>3. Fan-Powered Creator Economy</h2>
      <p>
        $BURNA shifts the traditional top-down entertainment model by giving fans a chance to invest in and influence creators directly. Fans can fund projects, vote on collaborations, and earn from community rewards and engagement. This creates a circular economy where every participant gains value from the platform's growth.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="feature">
      <h2>4. DeFi Infrastructure for Culture</h2>
      <p>
        $BURNA integrates decentralized finance (DeFi) into the heart of cultural engagement. Token holders can stake to earn passive income, participate in liquidity pools, and benefit from yield farming mechanisms. These tools create a sustainable financial layer that amplifies community wealth and supports platform longevity.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="feature">
      <h2>5. NFT Marketplace</h2>
      <p>
        The $BURNA NFT marketplace will showcase Afrobeat-themed digital assets including music, art, access passes, and more. It offers buying, selling, and trading capabilities, where every NFT can carry real utility — like unlocking events, merchandise, or virtual meet-and-greets with artists.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="feature">
      <h2>6. Token Utility & Rewards</h2>
      <p>
        $BURNA tokens serve multiple purposes: voting, staking, NFT access, payment for merch or event tickets, and earning through loyalty programs. Deflationary mechanisms such as token burns ensure value over time, and active participants are rewarded through gamified incentives.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="feature">
      <h2>7. Cultural Onboarding & Education</h2>
      <p>
        The platform includes educational initiatives, workshops, and onboarding tools to introduce new users — especially African youth — to blockchain, NFTs, and decentralized finance. This ensures inclusivity and empowers the next generation of creators and innovators.
